# meet_flutter_app

A instant Jitsi meet application.

## Getting Started

The FlutterJitsiMeet project contains the minimal implementation of the Jitsi instant meeting. The repository code is preloaded with some basic components like basic app architecture, app theme, constants and required dependencies to create a new project. By using boiler plate code as standard initializer, we can have same patterns in all the projects that will inherit it. This will also help in reducing setup & development time by allowing you to use same code pattern and avoid re-writing from scratch.
